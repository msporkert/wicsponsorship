                            Women in Computing is dedicated to supporting the community of women in computing at UC San
                            Diego. We hope to cultivate the next generation of women programmers, help foster a love for
                            science and technology, and increase the retention rate of women pursuing a career in tech.
                            Our organization is inclusive to members of all backgrounds, regardless of gender and major!

                            WIC organizes numerous events that develop our members both professionally and technically.
                            Each quarter we host 2-3 general body meetings, in which we discuss upcoming opportunities
                            and events; each GBM incorporates either a relevant workshop or an industry-organized
                            activity, such as a tech talk or engineer panel. Outside of general body meetings, WIC
                            organizes  independent technical workshops, such as resume reviews, mock interviews, and
                            app and web-development workshops. WIC further co-hosts a number of independent industry
                            events with different companies, which can vary from recruiting events to panels to tech
                            talks. One quarterly event that WIC plans is the Beginner’s Programming Competition, a
                            welcoming event in which students who have not taken upper division CSE courses complete
                            coding questions (similar to those in technical interviews) and compete for industry-sponsored
                            prizes.

                            To support the next generation of female programmers, WIC focuses on outreach events that
                            introduce high school girls to computer science. These include our mentorship program, ABLE,
                            and annual events, Shadow Day and Girls Day Out. WIC additionally collaborates with the UCSD
                            IDEA Center to plan other diversity-focused events, including Engineering Overnight Program,
                            BeWISE Workshops, and Professional Evening with Industry.

                            WIC has multiple mentorship programs and hosts various social events to allow members to
                            network with one another and find a supportive community. Our mentor-mentee program pairs
                            an upperclassmen student with an underclassmen student, while our industry mentorship
                            programs pair undergraduate students with female engineers at our partner companies.




                            <br />
                            Every year, WIC attends the <span class="emph">Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing </span>conference.
                            We aim to sponsor 20 students each year by covering the cost of tickets, airfare, and hotel, which can add up to $1,000 per person.
                            We believe attending diversity conferences like GHC can expose WIC members to a network and community of successful female engineers and
                            inspires them to continue pursuing computer science.
                            <br />
                            Sponsorships also allow us to hold <span class="emph">social events</span>, where our members can network with each
                            other and find a community of women who all support each other. With only <span class="emph">20%</span> of students in computer science classes being female,
                            it is more likely for women in computing to develop <span class="emph"> imposter syndrome </span>. Social events help women find friends,
                            study groups, and a support structure, which can be integral to their success.
                            <br />
                            We also do <span class="emph">outreach events</span> to inspire girls in high school to be engineer wow.
                            <br />

                            Women represent a valuable, and mostly untapped, talent pool in technology.  Do you want to help WIC and show your support for tomorrow's women in STEM? We like to partner with companies in industry to help our members learn about future career opportunities and foster industry presence at UC San Diego.
                            We are always accepting sponsorship for our events and donations to support as many women in computing as possible.

                            For 3+ years, Women in Computing has been putting on quarterly programming competitions for 200+ undergraduate students who have not taken upper-division Computer Science courses. The students solve 15 questions similar to those used in programming interviews in 2.5 hours.

                                Girls Day Out invites high school girls from the underrepresented Greater San Diego area to UCSD to participate in a day complete with an industry panel, lab tours, speakers from academia, and hands on workshops.
                                With a turnout of over 40 high school students, parents, and volunteers at the 2018 Girl’s Day Out, we have budgeted $3,000 for the 2019 Girl’s Day Out in the hopes of raising the number of attendees from 60 to 100. This cost covers facility costs, food and refreshments, promotional materials, and giveaway bags.

                            WIC wants to build long term relationships with companies and our board, but even moreover,
                            with students on campus who are being exposed to industry for the first time.
                            Company mentorship with students solves retention issues with minority groups in STEM.
                            When students can build trust with professionals who have already encountered issues they
                            are facing, they can learn by example and discover ways to overcome challenges with support.
                            We provide the space and resources needed to make wonderful professional relationships
                            build with UC San Diego students and company representatives.
