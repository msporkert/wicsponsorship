                            Women in Computing is dedicated to supporting the community of women in computing at
                            UC San Diego. We hope to cultivate the next generation of women programmers, help foster a
                            love for science and technology, and increase the retention rate of women pursuing a career
                            in tech. Our organization is inclusive to members of all backgrounds, regardless of gender
                            and major!

                            WIC organizes numerous events that develop our members both professionally and technically.
                            Each quarter we host 2-3 <span class="emph"> general body meetings</span>, in which we discuss upcoming opportunities
                            and events. Outside of general body meetings, WIC
                            organizes  independent <span class="emph"> technical workshops</span> and co-hosts a number of independent <span class="emph"> industry </span>
                            events with different companies.
                            WIC plans is a quarterly event for students who have not taken upper division CSE courses
                            called <span class="emph"> Beginner’s Programming Competition</span>, where they compete to solve coding questions
                            (similar to those in technical interviews) for industry-sponsored prizes.

                            To support the next generation of female programmers, WIC focuses on <span class="emph">outreach events</span> that
                            introduce high school girls to computer science.

                            WIC has multiple <span class="emph">mentorship programs</span> and hosts various <span class="emph">social events</span> to allow members to
                            network with one another and find a supportive community. Our mentor-mentee program pairs
                            an upperclassmen student with an underclassmen student, while our industry mentorship
                            programs pair undergraduate students with female engineers at our partner companies.

                            Women represent a valuable, and mostly untapped, talent pool in technology. Do you value
                            diversity enough to help WIC by showing your support for tomorrow's women in STEM? We
                            like to partner with companies in industry to help our members learn about future career
                            opportunities and foster industry presence at UC San Diego. We are always accepting
                            sponsorship for our events and donations to support as many women in computing as possible.

                            We base our sponsorship packet on the type of event that a company sponsors.
                            A social event typically reaches around 20 members. WIC hosted events are events that WIC plans
                            and organizes that ____. Examples of such an event are GBMs and ???.
                            For a company hosted event, WIC will help book a room and promote the event. These
                            events are tech talks, company panels, or recruiting events.
                            We are flexible we just want money.

                            This is one of Women in Computing’s most highly attended events, and is a great way to connect with top rising talent!

                            What is the Beginner Programming Competition?
                            For 3+ years, Women in Computing has been putting on quarterly programming competitions for 200+ undergraduate students who have not taken upper-division Computer Science courses. The students solve 15 questions similar to those used in programming interviews in 2.5 hours.

                                with college students majoring in engineering disciplines. WIC partners with the Society of Women Engineers and the San Diego Supercomputer Center
                                to plan workshops, lab tours, and socials.

                                Girls Day Out invites high school girls from the underrepresented Greater San Diego area to UCSD to participate in a day complete with an industry panel, lab tours, speakers from academia, and hands on workshops.
                                With a turnout of over 40 high school students, parents, and volunteers at the 2018 Girl’s Day Out, we have budgeted $3,000 for the 2019 Girl’s Day Out in the hopes of raising the number of attendees from 60 to 100. This cost covers facility costs, food and refreshments, promotional materials, and giveaway bags.

                                Shadow Day is an opportunity for high schoolers to live a day in the life of a college
                                student. Participants attend classes, meetings and spend time with a UCSD student to get
                                a glimpse of college life. Students are paired based on major preferences, though we
                                encourage that the students attend classes of atleast two different subjects. We budget
                                $500 for Shadow Day, which covers facility and food costs for participants and volunteers.

                            WIC wants to build long term relationships with companies and our board, but even moreover,
                            with students on campus who are being exposed to industry for the first time.
                            Company mentorship with students solves retention issues with minority groups in STEM.
                            When students can build trust with professionals who have already encountered issues they
                            are facing, they can learn by example and discover ways to overcome challenges with support.
                            We provide the space and resources needed to make wonderful professional relationships
                            build with UC San Diego students and company representatives.
